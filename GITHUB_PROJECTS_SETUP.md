## 📊 Step 7: Sync with ARCHITECTURE.md

Every week, update ARCHITECTURE.md with current progress from GitHub Projects:

2. Count completed items per phase
3. Calculate progress percentages
4. Update ARCHITECTURE.md:
   - Overall progress percentage
   - Component completion status
   - Hours spent vs estimated
   - Any new blockers

5. Commit updated documentation:
   git add ARCHITECTURE.md
   git commit -m "Update architecture progress [Date]"
   git push
```

## 🔍 Monitoring Progress

### Key Metrics to Track

In GitHub Projects, you can use the **"Insights"** tab to see:

```

```

### Monthly Review

Once per month:
1. Review total progress
2. Update PROGRESS.md
3. Adjust Phase 5 estimates
4. Plan next month's priorities

## 📋 ARCHITECTURE.md Integration

The ARCHITECTURE.md progress percentages should match GitHub Projects:

```markdown

## Phase 4: Provider Dashboard 🔄 0%

Status: NOT STARTED

### Components

| Component | Status | Completion |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| /provider/dashboard | ⏳ | 0% |
| /provider/listings | ⏳ | 0% |

# On GitHub Projects

Project Column "Todo":
- [ ] Phase 4: /provider/dashboard
- [ ] Phase 4: /provider/listings
- [ ] Phase 4: /provider/orders
```
